# runkeeper - Cumulative Paths

This repository is a personal project I cooked up during the COVID-19 pandemic. My goal was to be able to see the routes I'd taken, first walking, then cycling, during quarantine exercise, with the general goal of going places I hadn't been before. Along the way, I also started to log the locations of Little Free Libraries I saw, and added code to put them on the map.

Since I made it as a personal project, it's not super well-factored for adapting or reuse, but it isn't out of the question, especially for someone who's comfortable with the command line.  Probably it wouldn't really require much coding beyond a few config changes. I guess someone who didn't have a Little Free Library-type point-mapping project would need to delete or comment out some code too.

If someone else wanted to use this, they'd need to take a few steps:

* Create a Mapbox account and generate an access token, and update `main.js` to use the new token
